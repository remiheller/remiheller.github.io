# Google Tour Project
Attached below is a Google tour project I created. In it are 3 photos I took with a 360 camera. In addition, there are two scenes that are taken from Google. The purpose of the project is to show potential students what lower campus looks like and talk a little bit about the different buildings we see along the way.
